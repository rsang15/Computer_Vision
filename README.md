The project involves creating a system in which the input is a video stream. The video is in the form of a continuous stream of images. The video is then split into individual images called frames. Here the frames are extracted per second. We select the points where the virtual object is to be placed in each frame. It helps us to solve for the position in the images where the advertisement image i.e, virtual  object, is supposed to be inserted. With the help of warp perspective, we blend in the source image with the destination such that the advertisement image is present in each frame. The images are then sorted in alphabetical order to form a new video. The advertisement images can be inserted into any position in the video as per the user's requirement. The algorithm detects a predetermined position in the scene and replaces it with a user defined pattern
